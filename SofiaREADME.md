Project Name: TicTac(Toc)Toe | Class Name: Advanced Java Topics at Valley View High School | Date Submitted: December 13, 2021 
Description: Android Studio in Java was used. We were graded on GUI, logic, and teamwork. It's an interactive, two player game 
of tic tac toe, except we were required, by the "imaginary client", to make it a 4 by 4 grid design. | Partners? This was a 
group project; I worked with Alexyss Morales, Mario Castello, and Marc Encarnacion.
